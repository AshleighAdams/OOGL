OOGL Source Repository

OOGL is a collection of helper classes that aid in using non-deprecated OpenGL from C++.
By using the library appropriately, it is possible to compile the same application on Windows,
Linux, Mac OS X and Android using the NDK.

The following classes exist in the GL namespace and can be used to render OpenGL (ES) scenes.

- Window
- Context
- Color

Files are included to build the library with Visual C++ 2008, Visual C++ 2010, Code::Blocks
and plain g++. Samples are included to function as unit tests and usage examples.
