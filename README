By using the library appropriately, it is possible to compile the same application on Windows,
Linux and Mac OS X.

The following classes exist in the GL namespace and can be used to render OpenGL scenes.

- Context

Files are included to build the library with Visual C++ 2008, Visual C++ 2010, Code::Blocks
and plain g++. Samples are included to function as unit tests and usage examples.
